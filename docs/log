Ok, I'm refreshing my documentation and setting up my environment for running the code.
This time I'm going to organize the documentation and code into a git repo.

I need to add to doc:
- figures / plots with results
- description thereof

then print and bring in to Phil for discussion tomorrow

I need to put in the git repo:
- README.md
- documentation
- lib
- bin
- config.py

TODO:
have the code create output directory and store all plots and config files and code version to keep record of run
include output log instead of just using stdout
and versions of libraries
